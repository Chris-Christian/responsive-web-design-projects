# Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains the projects I built while completing the **[FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)**.  
These projects demonstrate the use of **HTML** and **CSS** to create responsive and accessible web pages.
